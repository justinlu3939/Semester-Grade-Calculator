### **Summary**
The following program is a simple calculator used to determine the final or current grade of a class, based on grades and weighted percentages. It was developed in Eclipse IDE and the programming language is in Java.
***
### **User Manual**
The user will be asked to first enter the name of a graded assignment type from the task such as "homework" or "quiz". Then, the user will be asked for the percentage of the assignment type. Afterwards, the user will input all the grades for that assignment type, entering '-1' to stop. When stopped, the user will be asked again for another assingment type, entering "stop" to stop. If the user "stops", the program will display to the console: the averages of each assignment type and the final calculated grade based on the percentages.
***
### **Completion, Bugs and Improvements**
The program works as intended, printing out the correct numbers and grades for the class. However, the input to the console must be of the appropiate type as it doesn't contain any try and catch exceptions. Improvements for the code could be including catch exceptions and possibly making the grades more precise by displaying more decimals.

### **Summary**
This was a personal project that I made to help me calculate the grade I would need to get on my final exam in order to secure an A. It is helpful and effective at determining the final grade for the course based on current grades and weighted percentages of each assignment type.
